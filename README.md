## What is TwitchTurtle?
TwitchTurtle is a streamlabs-integration system, which lets you accept tips while streaming with TurtleCoin; a fast, easy and private cryptocurrency.   

TwitchTurtle is reliable, easy to setup, and grants you more control on your donations. Tips show up faster, and fees are much lower compared to other options.
